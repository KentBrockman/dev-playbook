# To Do's

- vscode setup
- firefox - search engines, enable plugins
- collect manual setup tasks for things that shouldnt be automated (logging in to things, setting up ssh keys, etc)
- vim plugins - some require external dependencies. install dependencies for those plugins when they are installed (e.g. fzf, rg, deoplete)
- set up fork config strategy in README
- 3D printing tools - cura
- golang dev tooling
- node/js dev tooling
- file sync service
- handful of other nice tools (rerun, bat, fzf, rg, )
