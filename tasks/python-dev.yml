# Install tools for python development
# pyenv - tool for quicky changing python versions and virtualenvs
# pyenv's shim system CAN hijack env python,python2 and python3 where the package or binaries you need may not be installed
# If ANY python environments are having problems, 95% of the time it is a matter of:
# - troubleshooting PATH resolutions
# - reverse engineering shell construction
# - reading scripts to figure out who is referencing what
# - typing the following a million times:
#   - which python
#   - pyenv which python
#   - python -c "import sys; print sys.path"
# - then being satisfied there is no right way to do this, theres only a best way, which is the way you can understand or troubleshoot in the smallest amount of time
# It is good to remember ANY PYTHON INSTALL is just a collection of files installed somewhere on your machine and linked through path-based resolution mechanics, which are often haphazard and environment based
