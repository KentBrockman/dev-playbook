# The interface for binary installs is slightly different
# There is no predefined provider here
# This interface is a 'last resort' designed to address
# the case where the app you're trying to get is not
# available through the other package managers
#
# Required:
# - `url` to download from, presumably with a version
# Optionally:
# - `exec_name`, which may differ from app name e.g. minioclient vs mc
