# The interface for binary installs is slightly different
# There is no predefined provider here
# This interface is a 'last resort' designed to address
# the case where the app you're trying to get is not
# available through the other package managers
#
# You need to provide:
# - url to download from, presumably with a version
# - checksum for remote executable.
#   - this is used to determine if we have latest version
#   - value
#   - hash
#
# Optionally:
# - Executable name, which may differ from app name e.g. minioclient vs mc
# - zipped
