# Replace built in cd function with one that tweaks environment variables in a way that helps me
# make sure to add this to your global gitignore
# Inspired by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2785161/how-can-i-set-environment-variables-depending-on-directory

# What this does:
# - include .extra_envs file in directory, those environment variables will be set
# - unset these variables when you move away from that dir
# - automatically activate/deactivate .venv
# - evaluate second parameter like an expression for pwd

cd() {
    builtin cd "$@"
    eval `env-cd.py`
}
